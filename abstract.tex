\chapter{Abstract}

This research focuses on the development of a robust anti-spoofing system capable of accurately detecting diverse types of spoofing attacks, including speech synthesis and speech conversion, across multiple accents. These spoofing attacks pose a significant security threat, potentially resulting in unauthorized access, financial fraud, and identity theft. With the emergence of deep learning generative architectures, the vulnerability to spoofing attacks has heightened. However, the challenge lies in the performance degradation of anti-spoof models trained on English datasets when applied to Spanish datasets due to accent bias and the inadequate consideration of multiple accents in training datasets or feature extraction processes. To tackle this issue, the research aims to develop a comprehensive anti-spoofing architecture that encompasses front-end models for feature extraction and back-end models for classification. By evaluating the impact of different front-end and back-end architectures on diverse training sets, considering language and accent diversity, and analyzing the correlation between accents and feature extraction, the study seeks to enhance the robustness of anti-spoofing systems. The ultimate goal is to enable the detection of spoofing attacks regardless of the attacker's accent or language.
